# 8. Benefits of SMILES

SMILES offers several benefits:
- **Compactness**: Facilitates the representation of complex chemical structures in a few lines of characters.
- **Storage and Search**: Essential for database storage, allowing for easy search and comparison.
- **Computational Compatibility**: Ideal for use in modeling, visualization, and chemical simulation software.
- **Accessibility**: As a standard format, SMILES can be interpreted by various computational chemistry programs.
