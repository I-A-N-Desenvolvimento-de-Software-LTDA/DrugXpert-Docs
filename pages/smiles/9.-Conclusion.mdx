# Conclusion

The SMILES notation is an efficient and widely used system for describing molecular structures textually. In the **Appendix F - SMILES Notation Tutorial** of the **P2 Framework Manual 2012 by the EPA**, the EPA teaches how to use SMILES to represent molecules, facilitating the analysis and manipulation of chemical data. It is an important tool for chemists, especially in the context of sustainability, as it allows for the rapid identification and evaluation of compound properties and their environmental impacts.
