# Atoms with Charges and Stereochemistry

SMILES notation also allows the representation of charges and the spatial configuration of atoms.

- **Charges**: Represented by `+` for positive charges and `-` for negative charges.
- **Stereochemistry**: Uses the symbol `@` to define the spatial configuration around chiral atoms.

**Example of Charge**:
- **Ammonium Ion (NH4+)**: Represented as **[NH4+]**.

**Example of Stereochemistry**:
- **Lactic Acid**: For lactic acid, which has a chiral center, the configuration can be represented as **C[C@H](O)C(=O)O** for a specific configuration.
