# Branching

In SMILES, branching is indicated by parentheses `()`. This signifies that certain atoms or groups are connected to the immediately preceding atom.

**Example**:
- **Isopropanol ((CH3)2CHOH)**: Represented as **CC(C)O**.
  - Here, we have two **CHâ‚ƒ** groups attached to the second carbon atom. The parentheses indicate that **(C)** is a methyl group attached to the central carbon.
  
- **3-Methylpentane (C6H14)**: Represented as **CCC(C)CC**.
  - In this case, the third carbon in the main chain (CCC) has a branch **(C)**, indicating a methyl group.
