# Single and Multiple Bonds

The bonds between atoms are represented by different characters:
- **Single Bonds**: Represented without additional symbols.
- **Double Bonds**: Represented by `=`.
- **Triple Bonds**: Represented by `#`.

**Examples**:
- **Ethene (C2H4)**: Represented as **C=C**. Two carbon atoms are connected by a double bond.
- **Acetylene (C2H2)**: Represented as **C#C**. Two carbon atoms are connected by a triple bond.
- **Carbon Dioxide (CO2)**: Represented as **O=C=O**. The oxygen atoms are double bonded to the carbon on either side.
