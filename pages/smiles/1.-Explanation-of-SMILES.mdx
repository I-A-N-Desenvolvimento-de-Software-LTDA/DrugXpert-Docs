# Explanation of SMILES

The **SMILES** (Simplified Molecular Input Line Entry System) notation is a system that allows for the representation of chemical structures as a linear sequence of characters. This method facilitates the storage, analysis, and search of molecules in databases, as a SMILES sequence is easily interpreted by software.

The structure of a molecule is represented linearly, adhering to how the atoms are bonded. For example, each atom is written in sequence according to its position in the molecule, and the nature of its bonds is indicated by symbols (when necessary).
