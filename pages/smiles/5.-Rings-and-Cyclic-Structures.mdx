# Rings and Cyclic Structures

In SMILES, cyclic structures (rings) are indicated by numbers that follow the atoms forming the bond that closes the cycle. 

**Example**:
- **Cyclohexane (C6H12)**: Represented as **C1CCCCC1**.
  - The number **1** indicates that the first and last carbon are connected to form the cycle.

- **Benzene (C6H6)**: Represented as **C1=CC=CC=C1**.
  - In this case, the number **1** indicates the closure of the cycle, and the double bonds are represented by `=` between carbon atoms.

For molecules with multiple rings, different numbers are used to mark the start and end of each cycle.

**Example of a bicyclic compound**:
- **Decalin (a system of two fused rings)**: Represented as **C1CCC2CCCC2C1**.
  - Here, the cycles are formed using the numbers **1** and **2** to indicate the overlap of the rings.
