# Molecular Formula: An Overview

The molecular formula is a concise way to represent the elements and their quantities in a molecule. It is a cornerstone in the field of chemistry, offering insights into the composition and properties of compounds.

### Who Invented the Molecular Formula?
The concept of the molecular formula emerged in the 19th century during the development of modern chemistry. Swedish chemist Jöns Jacob Berzelius (1779–1848) is credited with introducing the system of using symbols to represent elements and their atomic composition in molecules. His contributions laid the groundwork for the symbolic representation used today.

This guide will explore the molecular formula through the lens of an example molecule, **C9H17NO4**, covering key aspects in detail.

## Historical Development

The journey of molecular formulas began in the late 18th and early 19th centuries. While Berzelius introduced the symbolic notation, several other scientists made crucial contributions:

- **Antoine Lavoisier (1743-1794)**: Laid the groundwork for modern chemistry and the understanding of molecular composition
- **John Dalton (1766-1844)**: Developed atomic theory, which was essential for understanding molecular relationships
- **Friedrich Wöhler (1800-1882)**: Demonstrated that organic compounds could be created from inorganic materials

## Benefits and Applications

Molecular formulas serve multiple crucial purposes in modern science and industry:

### 1. Scientific Research
