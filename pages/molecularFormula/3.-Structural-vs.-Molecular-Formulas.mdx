# 3. Structural vs. Molecular Formulas
While the molecular formula indicates the quantity of each atom, the structural formula provides a detailed layout of how these atoms are connected. For example:

- **Molecular Formula:** C9H17NO4
- **Possible Structural Formula:** 
  - Amino acid with ester groups
  - Complex organic compound with a nitrogen base

Understanding the structure is vital for predicting reactivity and properties.
