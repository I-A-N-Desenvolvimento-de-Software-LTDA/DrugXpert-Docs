# 6. Common Misconceptions
Some misunderstandings about molecular formulas include:

- **Assuming Structural Details:** Molecular formulas do not reveal atom arrangement.
- **Confusing with Empirical Formulas:** Empirical formulas represent the simplest ratio, not the exact count.
- **Overlooking Isomers:** Different compounds can share the same molecular formula.

Clarifying these misconceptions aids in accurate interpretation.
